## Project Abstract
In this project, we intend to build a web-based database for a chip-manufacture company that synthesizes various functions of an online order management platform. The platform allows the registration from both customers and employees, where customers can release order and the employees are able to manage the order under the assistance of the information gathered by the database. Payments can also be finished on the platform as it allows **high concurrency payment** and clash recovery. All transaction records will be stored in the online database for analytical needs.

To simulate a real company and satisfy its possible business needs, we will create **data visualization dashboard** that enables the operational analysis such as customer profile, order completion rate, and geometrical distribution of deliveries. Moreover, the platform automatically allocates the production tasks to various plants belonging to the company under certain geometric constraints and the **cost-minimization purpose**. According to the real-time data of each machine's availability, orders will be assigned to the nearest plant to the customer that is available to finish the task. The operation costs of each machines will also be taken into consideration when designing the production chain. The system will reinforce its production strategy based on past data and try to provide its users with clear decision supports.

## Database Creation and Data Generation
To create database schemas, run the sql file [``source/db_table.sql``](https://github.com/CSC3170-2022Fall/project-wiskey-drunkards/blob/main/source/db_table.sql).

To insert data into database schemas, run the sql file [``source/db_insert.sql``](https://github.com/CSC3170-2022Fall/project-wiskey-drunkards/blob/main/source/db_insert.sql).

To drop all the database schemas, run the sql file [``source/db_clean.sql``](https://github.com/CSC3170-2022Fall/project-wiskey-drunkards/blob/main/source/db_clean.sql).

To generate random data in .csv format, run the .ipynb codes in [``source/data_generation``](https://github.com/CSC3170-2022Fall/project-wiskey-drunkards/tree/main/source/data_generation).

The detailed information of database schemas is included in [``Database.md``](https://github.com/CSC3170-2022Fall/project-wiskey-drunkards/blob/main/Database.md).

## Remarks
Note that the Huawei cloud database RDS for MySQL that we rendered for our back end was paid to be available before Jan 11, 2023, thus after this date our web application may have some functions that do not work as expected. If you encounter issues related to it, please do not hesitate to contact us (the email links shown in Team Members section), and we will extend the service life of our Huawei cloud database.
