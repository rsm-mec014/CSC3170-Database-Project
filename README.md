# Web-based Database Dashboard

## Project Overall Description

Our project aims at developing a web platform based on a consumer database for the **Chipanda Semiconductor Manufacturing Company**. This platform allows customers to place orders, as well as enables staff to manage those orders. The platform is designed with  in mind, allowing it to easily accommodate future growth and changes in customer needs. In addition, the system has been designed with usability in mind so that customers can quickly and easily place their orders without any confusion or frustration. Finally, the system provides detailed reporting capabilities for both staff and consumers, which will allow them greater insight into order trends over time.

The target users of our platform are chip-manufacture corporations that need a secure, efficient, and easy-to-use system to manage customer orders. Our platform provides several advantages over traditional methods, such as:
- Increased concurrency measures to guarantee the successful payment during transmission and storage, providing scalability to accommodate future growth in demand;

- Detailed reporting capability provides greater insight into order trends;

- The system is designed with availability and transaction costs in mind, so plant managers can place orders in the most convenient and cost-effective manner.

By providing these features and benefits, we believe our platform will offer the best possible experience to both staff and customers alike.

For the complete report, please refer to [``CSC3170_Project_Report.pdf``](https://github.com/CSC3170-2022Fall/project-whiskey-drunkards/blob/main/CSC3170_Project_Report.pdf).

## ER Diagram

## Web Application Link
We have deployed the app on the cloud, the url is attached as follows:

https://chipandas.streamlit.app

If you want to run the app locally, refer to the following section.

## How To Run the App
All the web codes are stored in the web directory. The app is written with streamlit, a Python-based frontend language.

To run the app locally, first go to the web directory:
```
cd web/
```
To set up the environment:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To execute the code:
```
streamlit run main.py
```

Please notice that our report [``CSC3170_Project_Report.pdf``](https://github.com/CSC3170-2022Fall/project-whiskey-drunkards/blob/main/CSC3170_Project_Report.pdf) contains a more thorough explanation and covers more main functions of our project in detail.

## Database Creation and Data Generation
To create database schemas, run the sql file [``source/db_table.sql``](https://github.com/CSC3170-2022Fall/project-whiskey-drunkards/blob/main/source/db_table.sql).

To insert data into database schemas, run the sql file [``source/db_insert.sql``](https://github.com/CSC3170-2022Fall/project-whiskey-drunkards/blob/main/source/db_insert.sql).

To drop all the database schemas, run the sql file [``source/db_clean.sql``](https://github.com/CSC3170-2022Fall/project-whiskey-drunkards/blob/main/source/db_clean.sql).

To generate random data in ``.csv`` format, run the ``.ipynb`` codes in [``source/data_generation``](https://github.com/CSC3170-2022Fall/project-whiskey-drunkards/tree/main/source/data_generation).

The detailed information of database schemas is included in [``database_intro.md``](https://github.com/CSC3170-2022Fall/project-whiskey-drunkards/blob/main/database_intro.md).

## Remarks
Note that the Huawei cloud database RDS for MySQL that we rendered for our back end was paid to be available before Jan 10, 2023, thus after this date our web application may have some database-related functions that do not work as expected. If you encounter issues related to it, please contact rep_laureline@hotmail.com, and we will extend the service lifespan of our Huawei cloud database RDS.

There is a similar issue with the cloud of streamlit, where we deploy our app. If the app has not been visited for several weeks, it might sleep temporarily. Contact 120090527@link.cuhk.edu.cn if the app is sleeping.
